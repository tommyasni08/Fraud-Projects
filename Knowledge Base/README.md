# 🔍 Fraud Detection & Risk Management Knowledge Base

This repository is my **personal learning journey** into the world of **fraud detection, risk management, and trust & safety**.  
It is structured as a **knowledge base of modules**, covering key fraud domains and cross-industry patterns.

The content here is not code-focused but rather **theory + case studies + data/analyst perspectives**, written in a way that could help:

- **Fraud Analysts** understand common fraud vectors.
- **Data Scientists / Engineers** design signals, models, and detection features.
- **Algorithm Engineers** think about system-level trade-offs between detection, friction, and user experience.

## 📚 Learning Methodology

This repo is based on an **active research + mentor feedback loop**:

1. I research each topic using academic papers, industry reports, and case studies.
2. I draft structured answers to a set of guiding questions.
3. My mentor (fraud expert) reviews, corrects, and pushes me toward **industry-grade depth**.
4. The final output is documented here, module by module.

The emphasis is on **retention, structure, and cross-industry application** rather than speed.
