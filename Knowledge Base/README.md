# üîç Fraud Detection & Risk Management Knowledge Base

This repository is my **personal learning journey** into the world of **fraud detection, risk management, and trust & safety**.  
It is structured as a **knowledge base of modules**, covering key fraud domains and cross-industry patterns.

The content here is not code-focused but rather **theory + case studies + data/analyst perspectives**, written in a way that could help:

- **Fraud Analysts** understand common fraud vectors.
- **Data Scientists / Engineers** design signals, models, and detection features.
- **Algorithm Engineers** think about system-level trade-offs between detection, friction, and user experience.

Each module is designed to mirror **industry-grade fraud frameworks** used by leading companies in fintech, marketplaces, ride-hailing, e-commerce, and social platforms. It blends theory, practical data signals, and modeling considerations ‚Äî all written from the lens of _a practitioner learning for mastery, not memorization._ Each module includes:

- **Definitions & Key Concepts**
- **Typical Attack Patterns**
- **Real-World Case Studies**
- **Business Impact**
- **Signals & Data Features Analysts Monitor**
- **Data Scientist/Engineer Add-ons** (features, labeling, modeling considerations)

## üìå Notes

- Content is **theory-focused** ‚Äî no code here (for now).
- Examples and case studies are from **public domain sources** (news, regulator reports, industry whitepapers).
- I continuously refine each module as my knowledge deepens.
