# üìò Module 9 - Insurance Fraud & Claim Manipulation

## 0 TL;DR

Insurance fraud covers **intentional deception during policy purchase or claim** to obtain undeserved benefits.
It spans **underwriting fraud** (false disclosure), **claim fraud** (exaggeration, staging, duplication), and **provider/insider collusion**.
Modern detection uses **multi-source data fusion** (policy, claims, provider networks, telematics, medical codes), **graph/network analytics, text mining, and hybrid rules + ML + human investigation** pipelines under strict regulatory explainability requirements.

## 1. Definition & Scope

- **Insurance fraud**: Any deliberate misrepresentation causing financial gain to a claimant, provider, or intermediary.
- **Soft fraud**: Exaggeration or opportunistic inflation (e.g., ‚Äúbump-up‚Äù repair bills).
- **Hard fraud**: Planned events (staged accidents, ghost patients, arson).
- **Stakeholders**: Policyholders, claimants, healthcare providers, repair shops, agents, employees.

## 2. Motivations & Incentives

| Actor              | Motivation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Policyholder       | Lower premiums, gain payout, revenge, moral hazard (‚ÄúI‚Äôve paid for years‚Äù) |
| Organized rings    | High ROI, low prosecution risk, ability to recycle identities              |
| Providers          | Upcoding, phantom services, kickbacks                                      |
| Employees / Agents | Commission fraud, ghost policies, data leaks                               |

## 3. Fraud Lifecycle

| Stage                | Fraud Type                    | Example                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Underwriting**     | Misrepresentation             | Fake occupation, age, health data, mileage; ghost broking |
| **Policy Servicing** | Mid-term manipulation         | Adding coverage after event, document tampering           |
| **Claim Submission** | False or inflated loss        | Staged accident, fake receipts                            |
| **Settlement**       | Collusion or insider override | Adjuster‚Äìclaimant arrangement, double payouts             |
| **Post-claim**       | Recovery obstruction          | Fake bankruptcy, asset hiding                             |

## 4. Attack Vectors & Typologies

- **Auto**: Staged collisions, jump-ins (add fake passengers), inflated repair estimates, phantom towing.
- **Property**: Serial small fires/thefts, multiple claims for same loss, counterfeit invoices.
- **Health / Medical**: Upcoding CPT codes, billing for unrendered services, phantom clinics.
- **Life**: Fabricated death certificates, identity recycling across countries.
- **Workers‚Äô Comp**: Fake injuries, prolonged recovery with falsified medical certificates.
- **Agent Fraud**: Ghost policies, premium pocketing, fake beneficiaries.

## 5. Real-World Examples

- **U.S. Auto ‚ÄúCrash-for-Cash‚Äù Rings (2019‚Äì2022)**: Orchestrated collisions involving drivers, passengers, clinics, lawyers.
- **India Health-Insurance Scam (2021)**: Phantom hospitals filing thousands of COVID reimbursements with cloned patient IDs.
- **U.K. Ghost-Broking**: Brokers selling forged policies to drivers‚Äîvalid-looking but unregistered.

## 6. Business Impact

- **Financial**: Global insurance fraud ‚âà > $80 B / year (U.S. FBI est.).
- **Operational**: Higher loss ratios, SIU overload.
- **Pricing**: Honest customers subsidize fraud ‚Üí churn.
- **Regulatory**: Solvency, consumer-protection violations.
- **Reputational**: Perceived unfairness when false negatives or false positives occur.

## 7. Signals & Data Sources

**Structured Data**

- Policy metadata (tenure, coverage type, declared attributes).
- Claim data (amount, time since policy inception, cause codes).
- Provider data (hospital, garage, doctor, adjuster IDs).
- Payment & bank info, repair invoices, CPT/ICD medical codes.

**Unstructured / External**

- Text notes from adjusters & call logs.
- Photos, videos, EXIF metadata.

## 9. Graph & Network Analytics

**Graph Elements**

- **Nodes**: claimants, providers, adjusters, vehicles, addresses, phones, bank accounts.
- **Edges**: co-claims, shared assets, co-payments, phone/device reuse.

**Use-cases**

1. **Ring detection**: Dense components with repeated co-participation.
2. **Provider collusion**: Multiple claimants routed to same clinic/garage.
3. **Identity recycling**: Single individual appears in different roles across policies.
4. **Role ranking**: Degree/betweenness to find coordinators.

**Techniques**: Louvain/Leiden clustering, PageRank, node2vec embeddings + anomaly scoring.

## 10. Labeling Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge                                 | Mitigation                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Sparse confirmed fraud (few SIU outcomes) | Semi-supervised / PU learning; label propagation     |
| Investigation lag (months)                | Train on older closed cases; temporal validation     |
| Ambiguous outcomes (partial fraud)        | Multi-label scoring (clean / suspicious / confirmed) |
| Reviewer inconsistency                    | Centralized annotation schema, active learning loops |

## 11. Modeling Approaches

**Rules & Expert Systems**

- Red-flag indicators: early claim, high claim/premium ratio, same provider pattern.
- Business-auditable, fast to deploy.

**Supervised ML**

- Gradient boosting, logistic regression, neural nets on engineered features.
- Cost-sensitive learning weighted by claim amount.

**Unsupervised / Semi-supervised**

- Isolation Forest, autoencoders for rare-pattern detection.
- PU learning on labeled positives + unlabeled pool.

**Graph-based ML**

- Node embeddings ‚Üí clustering or classification (rings, providers).
- Temporal graphs for evolving fraud rings.

**Text & Image Models**

- NLP for adjuster notes; computer vision for accident-photo inconsistencies.

**Human-in-the-loop**
