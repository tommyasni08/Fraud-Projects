## Core Fraud Knowledge

1. Definition: What is synthetic identity fraud? How is it different from stolen identity fraud or new account fraud?

2. Motivations: Why do attackers use synthetic identities? What value do they get out of them?

3. Attack Vectors: How are synthetic accounts created? (e.g., combining real + fake data, document forgery, mule recruitment).

4. Industry Examples: Share at least one case study from banking/fintech and one from platforms/marketplaces.

5. Business Impact: What risks does onboarding fraud pose to businesses? (financial, regulatory, operational).

## Analyst / Data Scientist / Engineer Add-ons

6. Signals: What are the typical data fields/signals checked during onboarding/KYC that can indicate synthetic fraud?

7. Feature Engineering: What derived features can help identify duplicates or anomalies (e.g., address clustering, phone reuse)?

8. Graph Angle: How can graph analysis be applied to detect networks of fake identities?

9. Labeling Challenges: What makes it hard to build labeled datasets for synthetic identity fraud?

10. Modeling Angle: If you were building a model, what features/approaches would you prioritize (e.g., anomaly detection on identity fields, entity resolution models)?
